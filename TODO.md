# TODO
**Duplicated tools**  
Release.sh is generic and should exist only in one place (app-builder, perhaps, and accepting on the path to dir as a parameter).


**Duplicated dev-server tools**  
`main.js`, `index.html` and `vite.config.js` are the same amongst all apps.


**Make theme extractor optional on apps**


**Release tool should write app in commit message**
In addition to the version, it would be nice to know _what_ was being updated (now I have multiple apps)


**External SVGs**  
Find the Vite inline SVG plugin


**Server Browser**  
List all servers with the following data
- Root status
- Backdoor status
- Hackable status (with required hacking skill if not)
- Name
- Contract count
- Security
- Max money
- Current money %
- Threads to weaken
- Threads to grow
- Profit per second (assuming we hack for X%)

Toggle theming, sort on each column, hide/show purchased servers
