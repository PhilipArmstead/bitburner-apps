Registration

We use an email / password auth system so that we know who
is submitting the theme. We don't actually use the email,
we just use it for identification purposes.

Each login will create a PAT token stored in your local
storage. You can copy/paste it to avoid logging in, if you
want. You can also integrate using the same method, for your
own app. Go ahead! https://bitburner.daft.host
